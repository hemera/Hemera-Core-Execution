Execution Cycle:
1. An execution cycle is a complete iteration of all
   executors. It includes three parts:
   	1) Execution of cyclic task.
   	3) Notification of cycle observers.
2. Reason:
	A) Since executor threads need to execute in an
	   infinite loop to keep application running, it
	   is better to run the loop at a particular rate
	   such that it is easy for performance analysis.
	B) Cycle based execution imposes a fixed rate that
	   enhances the regularity of the system.
