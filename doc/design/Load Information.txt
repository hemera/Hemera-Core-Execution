Load Information:
Load information should take into account not only the
operating system level CPU workload and memory usage,
but also the current average queue length of all the
assist executors and the number of executors (threads)
per processing core. It is possible that the system is
in a waiting state when the query is made, thus giving
the RMS an inaccurate notification that the runtime is
completely free, and just right after the message is
sent, all waiting tasks become alive and start consuming
system resources fully. Then newly assigned clients by
the RMS will make the runtime overload.

The ranking system should be implemented on RMS rather
than on the execution framework. This allows the RMS
to fully control how the values are interpreted, thus
allowing RMS to be adjusted easily without affecting
the entire application system. If it were implemented
on the execution framework level, then once the ranking
algorithm is adjusted, all clients and servers must be
shutdown for re-deploy and restart.
